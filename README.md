# river-flow-database

This project involved designing and developing a program in C++ to read river flow data from a text file, create a linked list database to represent the annual records of the rivers, and allow for statistical analysis of the data. The program utilized file input and output techniques, including the use of ifstream and ofstream objects, to read and write data to text files. The goal of the project was to create a tool for efficiently storing and analyzing river flow data.
